# READ ME

Hi there this is the beginning point of my solo-development project to create a game over the summer. I dont have much experecne in creating games so we will have to see how this goes.

## The basic idea of the game is as follows:
you are creating a city on a 2-d board game style board. you can use money to buy new properties and place them on the map, each property will help you generate more money in one way or another. at the end of each year you need to pay a certain ammount of taxes, the game ends when you fail to pay your taxes in a given year.

simple, right? well i guess we will have to see
